Dogeify
==============

Dogeify is a Node.js super-webscale Doge-powered awesome-infused evented based streaming Doge injecting proxy server.

Think CloudFlare, but with Doge.

[Check it out live](http://www.dogeify.org/)


What is this?
--------------

This proxy is designed to insert tags, and also rewrite links, headers, cookies, etc
so it appears to transparently work as a man in the middle.

It also inserts Doge.

The proxy is designed to run on a wildcard domain *.SUFFIX_DOMAIN, and everything
are rewritten to match that domain.

It currently only supports HTTP sites (running on ports :80).


Configuration
--------------

These can be set by environment variables:

*PORT*
: Port proxy listens on
Default: 5000

*EXTERNAL_PORT*
: Port proxy appears to be listening on (eg, the front-end server)
Default: 80

*SUFFIX_DOMAIN*
: Domain that is appended when rewritting links
Default: 'dogeify.org'

*LOG_FORMAT*
: Connect Middleware style log format
Default: ':method :status :response-time \t:req[Host]:url :user-agent'

Setup
--------------

You will need PostgreSQL installed. Additionally, run this in your terminal:

    createuser -P -e dogeify

Run these in your Postgres console:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "dogeify" to dogeify;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE "sites" TO dogeify;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE "users" TO dogeify;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE "payments" TO dogeify;

    CREATE FUNCTION update_changetimestamp_column()
    RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
       NEW.updated_at = now();
       RETURN NEW;
    END;
    $$ language 'plpgsql';

    CREATE TRIGGER update_ab_changetimestamp BEFORE UPDATE
    ON payments FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
    update_changetimestamp_column();

Here's the command I use to run it locally:

    SUFFIX_DOMAIN=dogeify.org.local PORT=5000 EXTERNAL_PORT=9000 LOCAL_MODE=1 LIBRATO_AUTH=EMAIL:API_KEY DEBUG=1 node --debug server.js
