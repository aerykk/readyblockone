### Our Story

<p>
    Founded in 2016 by [Eric Muyser](http://ericmuyser.com), Stoke Games is an independent game development studio based out of Vancouver, Canada. 
</p>

<p>
    We aspire to be the most community-involved game company in the world. We know it all starts with the player experience, and we know the community will eventually know better than we will. We were established in 2016 by a passionate gamer who believe community-first game development that will always result in awesome games. In 2016, we released our debut title, Hackatron, in less than a few months of development.

    You should be able to play your game on all major platforms. Windows. Mac. Linux. iPhone. Android. Not a similar game. The same game.
