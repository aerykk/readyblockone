                                <p>There are any number of ways to trade cryptocurrencies. However, as a new &amp; emerging market, most are complicated. <br /><br />
                                    That's why eToro created an all-in-one platform, to simplify trading for the average investor. <br /><br />
                                    They're unique value prop is they let you follow and copy the strategies of experienced traders, what they call "social trading". <br /><br />
                                    It's really easy to get started. As with anything, please do your own due diligence and only invest what you can afford to lose. <br /><br />
                                    As a best practice, we recommend depositing and withdrawing, just so you know you can get funds in &amp; out without hassle. <br /><br />
                                    Try eToro out, and if you like or don't like it let us know.
