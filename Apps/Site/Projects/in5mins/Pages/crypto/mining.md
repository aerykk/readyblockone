<p>It's quite common for new blockchain enthusiasts to get into mining. The general mindset is that <em>"if it can pay for the hardware in 1-2 years and the rest is profit, why not?"</em>. The only problem with type of thinking is relies upon the token being mined to maintain its value. It is essentially specualating on the price, with manual upkeep. Thus, it is considered by more experienced miners not to be worth it unless you are more interested in the technology and process. There are a few ways mining can be super profitable, but they are often reserved for the wealthy.</p>

    <li>1. Subsidize the energy costs, either through government rebate, solar energy, etc.</li>
    <li>2. Packaging equipment as a stock or something, allowing you to reinvest the profits to grow the operation</li>
