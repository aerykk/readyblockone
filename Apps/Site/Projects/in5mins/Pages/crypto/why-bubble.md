There's a number of important reasons why bubbles form and are important for the further development of the space.

* Every average joe around the world is now an investor from his couch. He can find all the details about the company, team bios, and updates with a mouse click.
* People trying to help each other out, so less people getting suckered into pump n dumps. People believe in what they're investing much more.
* Network effort
 * Investors becoming youtubers spreading the word further
* ICOs. Locking up a lot of funds, keeps circulation going. Drives hype.
* Exchange capacity building tension. Exchanges blocking new registration.
* Coordinated effort to stop it from popping. 
 * CoinMarketCap removing Korea from listings, appeared to make market crash, but actually helped it keep thriving.
 * Bitfinex lending more USD tether when they want BTC to surge
* Lots of people on the sidelines who feel like they missed out
* Attack on Bitcoin, alts trying to replace it
* Not easy to short. Not easy to get money out. You can't just call a broker and tell him to sell it all for USD.
* Buy and hold mentality. Millionaire mentality. Buy the dip mentality (after it worked so well in 2008).
* Manipulation from many parties, Bitfinex, CoinMarketCap, etc.
* Every time one country becomes a risk, people switch enthusiasm to a different country.

On the flip side:

* People are pulling out, but it's slow. They're trying to find ways to avoid taxes. They're trying to find accountants that know about crypto.

The market moves in waves. There's the wave when people panic into bitcoin. There's the wave when they get bored and disappoint with bitcoin and move into altcoins. There's smaller waves around specific subjects, like privacy, decentralized internet, credit cards, insurance, etc.
