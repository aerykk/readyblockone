</div>
<p><strong>So you've probably been hearing your favourite blockchain is susceptible to what's called a 51% attack. What is a 51% attack?</strong></p>
<p>It's basically what it sounds like. It's when 51% of the network attacks the rest of the network. Decentralized technology relies upon consensus of a majority of the network, unless it's not truly decentralized (at the time of writing that includes Ripple, IOTA, and others). Some networks require less. For instances Ethereum, which relies on Byzantine fault tolerance, which has a 33% threshold.</p>

<p><strong>What typically happens when bad actors attain the required majority?</strong></p>
<p>Since a blockchain is transparent, bad actors like this are discovered early and it often results in a hard fork. Between the time of the attack and suspension of the main chain, attackers are able to forge transactions, essentially stealing money, and exchange them on exchanges for different tokens. When it's discovered, a roll back will occur and a new chain will be started from before the attack (often called a hard fork). This action is not taken lightly as it requires governance, and decentralized technology is meant to be governless. As such it will only be successful if the core developers and most miners agree to do it. After the hard fork, all exchanges and software to update to the new chain. There have been cases where enough developers/miners did not agree on the hardfork, and maintained the old attacked chain, resulting in competing chains. Ethereum Classic is the most well known situation of this happening.</p>
