#### DAO

An acronym for “Decentralised Autonomous Organisation” (also known as DACs). The DAO is a company that could carry out business according to hard-coded rules, needing no human management. Examples of rules include setting aside a certain percentage of earnings for a cause or determining a process by which such a rule could be changed.
