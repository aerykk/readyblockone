Digital is the future. Currency must be digital.

* Governments will issue their own digital currencies. Why?
  * Traceability
  * Accurate inflation


This is all part of a larger transition to a connected world, IoT, AI, automation, etc. Much of the workforce will need to adapt. We are early.

**Why blockchain?**

Blockchain technology is replacing a lot of the old fluff. People often equate it with the Internet. I don't believe it's quite the same. The Internet brought a lot of new tech. Blockchain is more about consolidating pretty much everything in the world into a trustless ledger. Currencies, databases spanning every different field.

Blockchain is leveraging technology that has been building up for decades. It's the huge payoff for all the work done to get us to this point. We have an opportunity to take advantage of it. If we don't the drug dealer next door will. When it's over, we can find some way to give back.

**Why is it moving so quick?**

Blockchain technology spans all sectors. Since it's a generic solution that can be applied to many different fields, finance, medical, government, manufacturing, etc. it has spread like wildfire. Not only do organizations want to use it, but people see the opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

Crypto never stops. It runs 24/7. Every moment of every day is an opportunity. There's no waiting until morning to figure out the value of something. The value is being determined constantly.

For the last 20 years we've been building towards this. 20 years ago in the dotcom bubble, most people didn't know how to use a computer and there were few standards. These days everybody knows how to use computers, love tech, and have a smartphone in their pocket. Getting people used to online banking and online visa payments. Getting people used to crowdfunding through kickstarter. Getting people used to social chats like Slack, Discord, Telegram. People getting used to buying the dip (very successful strategy in 2008 housing crisis). It all built up to this moment.

It's also partly due to misunderstanding about money. Most people believe currency is only a form of currency issued by the government, but currency is actually anything that has these 5 properties: scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability, transferability. Cryptocurrencies have all these properties and more. As the world has become more capitalist and dependent on large organizations like Facebook, Apple, Google, people now trust them more than the government. Organization-issued currency is a heist on government-issued currencies.
