        <p>Welcome to this new series on learning Japanese with Pokemon. I hope my findings here can help someone else ease the learning curve in a fun way.</p>
        <p>I’m trying to learn Japanese, so naturally I was thinking “let’s translate Pokemon!” Pretty quickly found it was difficult to know if my translation was correct. There’s large meaning and differences in the little fragments of Japanese. So, I decided to try playing both translations at the same time.</p>
        <p>It’s been working out pretty well. With <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://jisho.org" target="_blank">Jisho.org</a></span> I can usually find the meaning of a stem. Many times I can already find it on <a href="http://memrise.com" target="_blank">Memrise</a>, with voice and all.
            <br> So, I’ve been keeping a log of all the dialog, and pulling out the vocab into lessons on Memrise. That way, I can use spaced repetition learning to review the vocab before starting to play the game again. When the word pops up, as it inevitably does because it’s for kids, I can understand the sentence better.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <h3><strong>Course</strong></h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>Find it on Memrise:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.memrise.com/course/292995/pokemon-platinum-2/" target="_blank">http://www.memrise.com/course/292995/pokemon-platinum-2/</a></span>
        </p>
        <p>Find the notes on Evernote:&nbsp;<a title="https://www.evernote.com/pub/daemn/pokemonplaythrough" href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/daemn/pokemonplaythrough#b=b59d0fb0-6db8-4c8a-a7cb-9140043d8cd6&amp;st=p&amp;n=95883331-abb1-4e65-b768-e017e689187d" target="_blank">https://www.evernote.com/pub/daemn/pokemonplaythrough</a>
        </p>
        <p>After having started this, I quickly realized I should have a lesson for each area, that way a person can study/review an area’s vocabulary when they get there so they can follow along more easily. Also that way there isn’t too many Pokemon names to study at once.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong></strong>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Plans</strong></h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Around 100 lessons, including all routes and cities</li>
            <li>Index page with the transcript and words in each lesson, including notes on a particular piece of sentence when necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I really want to make it the best it can be for learning Japanese with Pokemon.
