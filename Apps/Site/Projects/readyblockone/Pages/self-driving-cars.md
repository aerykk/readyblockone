Since the Xbox Kinect has been released, there's been a lot of adoption for physically self-aware devices. Someone even joked how this technology could be used to put a gun on a robot that detects objects and shoots at them. 

Take a look at this open source visual library: https://github.com/opencv/opencv

It seems very clear that's where this technology is going. It's going in the way of self-driving and self-aware devices.

There will absolutely be a self-driving car in the next 10 years. I can see Google being at the forefront of this, they already have those cars driving around that take 3D images for Google Streets.
