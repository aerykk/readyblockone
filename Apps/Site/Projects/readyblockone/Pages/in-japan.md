        <p>I moved here in November, 2012. Some things I’ve noticed..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lights don’t come on after a movie in the theatre until after the credits and half of the people wait to get up and leave.</li>
            <li>Employees will sometimes randomly go outside of their store and start bowing to everyone and the passing cars.</li>
            <li>At clothing stores, it’s custom for the cashier to walk you to the door carrying your bag.</li>
            <li>They pronounce Nike, nee-kay.</li>
            <li>At any time, there’s a good chunk of the population gambling at slot machines. They have 3-10 of these gambling facilities in even very small cities.</li>
            <li>They play a peaceful tune at 8am, 12pm and a peaceful song at 5pm.</li>
            <li>Air conditioners also function as heaters and are very common.</li>
            <li>Mitsubishi makes air conditioners.</li>
            <li>They eat chicken wings and fries with chopsticks.</li>
            <li>Chopsticks should face left.</li>
            <li>Never try to&nbsp;cooperate&nbsp;with chopsticks. It’s&nbsp;considered&nbsp;rude.</li>
            <li>They advertise porn magazines right in the window of some convenience stores.</li>
            <li>The pizza is truly horrible. Primarily due to low quality, soft cheddar and&nbsp;mozzarella&nbsp;cheese. Secondly because they put all sorts of weird ingredients on it. Corn, potatoes, broccoli, pretty much anything. Not a thin sliced sausage, but a bunch of huge sausages. I didn’t order a hotdog, I ordered a pizza.</li>
            <li>Japanese people need rice with most meat. Potatoes are not a substitute.</li>
            <li>Japanese people seem overly concerned with freshness. When you open up a pack of cookies or snacks, usually each one is wrapped in its own plastic wrapper (individually wrapped).</li>
        </ul>
