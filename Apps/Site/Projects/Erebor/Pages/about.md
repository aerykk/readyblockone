        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I’m Eric Muyser. I’m a software developer from Vancouver, Canada.</p>
        <p>I started coding websites for games in middle school and never stopped. I’ve built many websites, apps, frameworks, plugins, and have a huge advocate for open source. I’ve always been fascinated with the potential of data and API-driven apps, leading me to focus on web crawling with JavaScript as my tool of choice. I’m very interested in Japanese culture and travel there frequently.</p>
        <p>These days I work as a software developer at Hootsuite. I also build stuff on the side, ask me about it.</p>
